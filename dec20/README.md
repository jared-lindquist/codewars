1. In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

2. Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.

Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

----------------------
3. You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.

Write a function to return the 3rd.

Note: only positive integers will be tested.
-----------------------
4. Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.
-----------------------
5. 
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.
-----------------------
6. 
Write function bmi that calculates body mass index (bmi = weight / height2).

if bmi <= 18.5 return "Underweight"

if bmi <= 25.0 return "Normal"

if bmi <= 30.0 return "Overweight"

if bmi > 30 return "Obese"
-------------------------------
7. Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]
------------------------------
8. Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
Good Luck!
