1. In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
makeNegative(1);    // return -1
makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
makeNegative(0);    // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

2. Implement a function which convert the given boolean value into its string representation.

Note: Only valid inputs will be given.

----------------------
3. You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.

Write a function to return the 3rd.

Note: only positive integers will be tested.
-----------------------
4. Nathan loves cycling.

Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.

You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.
-----------------------
5. 
Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.
-----------------------
6. 
Write function bmi that calculates body mass index (bmi = weight / height2).

if bmi <= 18.5 return "Underweight"

if bmi <= 25.0 return "Normal"

if bmi <= 30.0 return "Overweight"

if bmi > 30 return "Obese"
-------------------------------
7. Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]
------------------------------
8. Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
Good Luck!
----------------------------
9. Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.
----------------------------
10. Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
----------------------------
11. Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
--------------------------
12. You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left.

Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not.

Function should return true if it is possible and false if not.
------------------------
13. Count the number of divisors of a positive integer n.
------------------------
14. Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
------------------------
15. Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.
